# Nonlinear-Finite-Element-Code-for-2D-Problems
A program for solving nonlinear boundary value problems in solid mechanics with nonlinear material behaviour and large deformation. To start, modify and run 'Run_code.mlx'.

## Instruction
The code provides both static and dynamic (alpha method) solver for 2-D boundary value problem with the consideration of large deformation.



Formulation: Updated Lagrangian & Total Lagrangian

Element: Quadrilateral Element

Numerical Quadrature: 2-Points Gaussâ€“Legendre Quadrature

Material: Neo-Hookean Material

Quadratic convergence rate has been achieved with consistent tangent matrix.
